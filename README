NAME
    Task::Business::AU - A Task module for Australian Businesses

DESCRIPTION
    There is a gradual awareness in Australia that Open Source is good for
    business. But the modules that have been created so far are somewhat
    ad-hoc, and scattered around.

    The goal for Task::Business::AU is to provide a focus for the
    development of Australia-specific Business:: modules, and provide a
    single " cpan Task::Business::AU " command that can be used to install
    all the modules in one hit.
